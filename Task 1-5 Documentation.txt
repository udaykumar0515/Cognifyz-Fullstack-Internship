### **Server-Side Code (Node.js with Express)**

1. **Setup**:
   - **`const express = require('express');`**: Imports the Express library to build the server.
   - **`const path = require('path');`**: Imports the Path library to handle file paths.
   - **`const bodyParser = require('body-parser');`**: Imports Body-Parser to handle form data.

2. **Create Server**:
   - **`const app = express();`**: Creates a new Express application.
   - **`const PORT = 3000;`**: Defines the port number where the server will run.

3. **Middleware**:
   - **`app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`**: Tells the server to use Body-Parser to process form data.

4. **Views**:
   - **`app.set('view engine', 'ejs');`**: Sets EJS as the template engine to generate HTML pages.
   - **`app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));`**: Specifies where the EJS templates are located.

5. **Routes**:
   - **`app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.render('Task1'); });`**: When someone visits the root URL (`/`), the server will display the `Task1.ejs` template.
   - **`app.post('/submit', (req, res) => { const formData = req.body; console.log(formData); res.send('Form submitted successfully!'); });`**: When the form is submitted, the server will:
     - Get the submitted data.
     - Print the data to the console.
     - Send a message saying "Form submitted successfully!" back to the user.

6. **Start the Server**:
   - **`app.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`); });`**: Starts the server and listens for requests on port 3000. When the server starts, it logs a message to the console.

## **Task 2**

### **Client-Side (HTML)**

1. **Dynamically Adding Phone Numbers**:
   - A section (`div`) to add multiple phone numbers dynamically.
   - The button `"Add Another Phone Number"` adds a new phone input field and a remove button using JavaScript.

2. **Country Selection with Conditional Fields**:
   - Dropdown for country selection, which reveals an additional input field for "Other Country" if the user selects "Others."
   - Uses the JavaScript function `toggleOtherFields()` to conditionally display the "Other Country" field.

3. **Date of Birth Dropdowns (Day, Month, Year)**:
   - The options for the day are generated dynamically using JavaScript.
   - The month and year dropdowns are statically defined, but the year dropdown is populated using a loop from the current year back to a specified year, allowing for a range of birth years.

### **Server-Side (Node.js/Express)**

1. **Phone Numbers**:
   - The form allows the user to submit multiple phone numbers as an array. This is handled by `req.body.phone`, which collects all the phone inputs.

2. **Resume Field**:
   - The field `resume` is introduced, where the user is prompted to share the resume via email. Although it's an optional section, it's captured in the server-side data.

3. **Submission Result Rendering**:
   - After successful submission, the server generates a dynamic HTML response displaying all the submitted details (including multiple phone numbers, if provided).
   - The `window.history.back()` function allows users to go back to the previous form page after viewing the results.

4. **Storing Form Data**:
   - Data is stored in a file (`submissions.txt`) as JSON strings. Each submission appends a new line with the full form data.

### **JavaScript Functions**

- **`addPhoneNumber()`**: Dynamically adds input fields for phone numbers.
- **`toggleOtherFields()`**: Displays the "Other Country" input field if "Others" is selected from the country dropdown.
- **`isValidEmail()`**: Validates email format using a regular expression.

     - **`<ul class="nav nav-tabs">`**: Defines a navigation bar with tabs.
     - **`<div class="tab-content">`**: Contains the content for each tab.

2. **New Sections**:
   - **About Me**:
     - A detailed introduction about yourself, including your skills and programming interests.
   - **Services**:
     - Lists the various services you offer, like web development, front-end design, back-end development, etc.

3. **Animations**:
   - **CSS Animation**:
     - Introduced a **fade-in effect** using keyframes for smoother transitions between tabs.
     - **`@keyframes fadeIn`**: Defines the fade-in effect from opacity 0 to opacity 1.

4. **Form Improvements**:
   - **New Fields**:
     - Introduced fields like "Internship Domain" using radio buttons for domains like Full Stack, Machine Learning, etc.
     - "Number of Weeks" dropdown to select the duration of the internship.
   - **Updated Skills Section**:
     - Added more skill options (e.g., C, C++, Java) using checkboxes.
   
5. **CSS Enhancements**:
   - **Custom Button Hover Effect**:
     - Buttons change color when hovered using CSS transition.
     - **`button:hover`** changes the background color on hover.
   - **Footer Styling**:
     - Added a fixed footer with customized styles (e.g., background color, text alignment).

6. **JavaScript Functions**:
   - **`handleFormSubmission()`**:
     - Handles form data dynamically and prevents default form submission.
     - Extracts all selected domains and appends them to the form before submitting.

### **Server-Side (Node.js/Express)**

1. **Domain Selection**:
   - **Internship Domain Handling**:
     - Captures the selected internship domain (e.g., Full Stack, Machine Learning) from the form.
     - The value of the domain radio buttons is collected and stored in the file.

2. **Number of Weeks**:
   - **Dropdown Handling for Weeks**:
     - Captures the number of weeks for the internship selected by the user.
     - Stored along with other form data.

3. **Enhanced Submission Result Page**:
   - **Submission Result Page (HTML)**:
     - Displays the submitted data, including the selected internship domain and number of weeks.
     - Uses a **Go Back button** to allow users to navigate back after submission.

4. **File Storage**:
   - **Data Storage**:
     - Form data is saved in the `submissions.txt` file with the newly introduced fields, such as domains and weeks.

## **Task 4**

### **Client-Side (HTML/CSS/JS)**

1. **Password and Confirm Password Fields**:
   - **New Form Fields**:
     - **Password Field**: Added a `password` input field and a `confirm-password` input field to ensure the user confirms the password.
     - **Show/Hide Password Feature**: Introduced a button (`togglePassword`) that toggles the visibility of the password fields between text and password types.

2. **JavaScript for Password Validation**:
   - **Password Requirements**:
     - Minimum length of 8 characters.
     - Must include at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase

 letter, one number, and one special character.
   - **Validation on Submission**:
     - If passwords do not match or do not meet criteria, the form submission is blocked, and an error message is displayed.

3. **Enhanced Form Submission Handling**:
   - **JavaScript Function**:
     - Handles dynamic field validation.
     - Provides visual feedback for errors in password fields.

### **Server-Side (Node.js/Express)**

1. **Password Handling**:
   - **Validation**:
     - Validates password criteria (length, character types).
     - Ensures that passwords meet the specified requirements.

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - **Password Storage**:
     - Password is stored in the text file but should ideally be hashed and secured in a real application.

3. **Form Data Exclusion**:
   - **Excluding Password from Display**:
     - Ensures that the password is not displayed in the result HTML page or stored in an easily readable format.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **Proper Error Responses**:
     - Sends appropriate error responses if validation fails, providing feedback to the user about why the submission was unsuccessful.
